üè¶ Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform

1. Overview

Credit scoring is the backbone of lending decisions. Traditional models are often black boxes, hard to interpret, and rarely integrate real-time data like stock performance, macroeconomic conditions, or news sentiment.

This project introduces a data-driven, explainable credit intelligence system that is:

Transparent: Explains why a company is classified as high or low risk

Interpretable: Easy for stakeholders to understand

Data-rich: Uses multiple structured and unstructured data sources

2. Features

Fetches structured data: Stock prices (Yahoo Finance), GDP (Alpha Vantage)

Fetches unstructured data: Company news sentiment (NewsAPI)

Builds an interpretable Decision Tree model to classify credit risk

Uses Explainable AI (SHAP) for feature-level explanations

Interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization

3. Technical Stack

5. Code Flow

Imports & Config: Load all required libraries and store API keys

Data Ingestion:

get_stock_data: Downloads last 6 months of stock prices

get_macro_data: Fetches GDP data via Alpha Vantage

get_news_sentiment: Collects company news and computes sentiment scores

Model Training:

Creates features (returns, volatility)

Labels companies as High Risk (1) or Low Risk (0)

Trains a Decision Tree classifier

Explainability:

Uses SHAP TreeExplainer to calculate feature contributions

Visualizes which features influence credit risk predictions

Streamlit Dashboard:

Inputs: Stock ticker & company name

Visual outputs: Stock charts, GDP data, news sentiment, credit risk prediction, SHAP plots

6. Demo Flow

Enter a company ticker (e.g., AAPL)

System fetches:

Stock data

Macro indicators

News sentiment

Model predicts credit risk (Safe / Risky)

Dashboard shows why the prediction was made (e.g., high volatility ‚Üí risky)

Decision-makers can trust and verify the model
